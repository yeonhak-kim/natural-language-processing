If you're new to Google Colab we recommend looking at [this](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/basic_features_overview.ipynb) intro notebook before getting started with this project. In short, Colab is a Jupyter notebook environment that runs in the cloud, it's recommended for all of the programming projects in this course due to its availability, ease of use, and hardware accessibility. Some features that you may find especially useful are on the left hand side, these being:\n","\n","*   Table of contents: displays the sections of the notebook made using text cells\n","*   Variables: useful for debugging and see current values of variables\n","*   Files: useful or uploading or downloading any files you upload to Colab or write while working on the projects\n","\n","\n","\n","**To begin this project, make a copy of this notebook and save it to your local drive so that you can edit it.**\n","\n","\n","If you want GPU's (which will improve training times), you can always change your instance type to GPU by going to Runtime -> Change runtime type -> Hardware accelerator.\n","\n","If you're new to PyTorch, or simply want a refresher, we recommend you start by looking through these [Introduction to PyTorch](https://cocoxu.github.io/CS4650_spring2022/slides/PyTorch_tutorial.pdf) slides and this interactive [PyTorch Basics notebook](http://bit.ly/pytorchbasics). Additionally, this [Text Sentiment](http://bit.ly/pytorchexample) notebook will provide some insight into working with PyTorch for NLP specific problems.
